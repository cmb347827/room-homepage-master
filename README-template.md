## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery/Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I had some trouble keeping the buttons for the carousel in place , as they appear above the image/text in the carousel html, and 
  they had to appear steady in different positions for mobile and desktop. 
  I figured out 
- Then it was a problem, keeping the buttons the same location still when resizing when I had to add padding to the texts.

- Next, was the images that were the same but different sizes. I know that the `<picture>` element works for this, to force a change at different screensizes. Or `<img>` with `scrcet` can be used, but then it's up to the browswer to determine when to change the image. 

    
 
### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
